#Used Electronics Classification Prediction

##Overview
This repository contains a project focused on classifying used electronics based on various features using machine learning techniques, specifically Random Forest, XGBoost, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The goal of this project is to predict the category of used electronic items, which can be beneficial for both consumers and sellers in the second-hand market.

##Why This Project is Helpful
As the market for used electronics continues to grow, accurately classifying these items can help streamline the buying and selling process. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we can create models that assist users in making informed decisions about pricing, categorization, and market trends. This project aims to provide insights into how different features influence the classification of used electronics, ultimately enhancing user experience and efficiency in the marketplace.
